1	And what they have said about him has not been pretty .
1	Business groups and labor unions joined in a giant protest , perhaps knowing that portions of the military were on their side .
3	The Kyoto Protocol is a first major step .
1	But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it .
3	But the Prime Minister 's official spokesman today said Tony Blair was pleased with the progress that had been made on the military , diplomatic and humanitarian fronts .
3	In November , President Bush promised to give the Philippines a $ 100 million antiterrorism aid package that would include weapons , training and shared intelligence .
3	The campaign so far showed Alliance military success was the best way of getting food in , he said .
1	However , the new plan does not lead to such a stabilisation , but instead will lead to the increase of absolute emission levels .
1	Bill Nash , a retired Army major general and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , said this amounted to " imposing on them a psychological sense of isolation , domination and futility , and trying to establish the conditions by which you can then reward them for information , as oppose to punish them . "
3	The EU will continue on its current path of emission reduction and is optimistic that other major players , notably Japan and Russia , will join us in these efforts .
1	There is no protection of women rights including their respect and sanctity .
3	The IHRC said in a statement to mark December 10 , " international day for human rights " that the international community has formulated numerous documents to honor human rights after 50 years of bitter experience and the heavy losses that the humanity has suffered .
3	With the signing of the protocol , he said , GCEP hopes to attract more funding to contribute to the international community 's efforts in reducing greenhouse gases , which trap heat in the earth 's atmosphere thus causing climate change .

3	The " three liters for 100 kilometers " car , high efficiency turbines , and solar panels are export successes and their development is driven by a climate protection policy of growing amplitude .
1	For South Africa , the main concern is regional stability , not the niceties of participatory democracy .
3	The win gives the 78-year - old Mr. Mugabe a six - year term in office and was hailed by Patrick Chinamasa , Zimbabwe 's Justice Minister , as a " runaway victory . "

1	Bush repeated his rejection of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol aimed atcurbing global warming , and pushed for the alternative he announced last week .
3	Nevertheless , the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous .
1	Researchers have shown that without a determined policy on climate coordinated at international level the consequences of climate change will be dramatic .
1	You talk about what we 're doing tangibly in every other country but Saudi Arabia .
1	With an annual economic growth objective of 3 percent , absolute US emissions in 2012 will be 24.5 percent more than 1990 levels , despite the improvement in energy efficiency .
3	He said that the Government of Pakistan remains committed to promoting and protecting human rights and will welcome the assistance of friendly countries towards that end .
1	In Los Angeles , a federal district judge questioned today whether he had the authority to consider a challenge to the detention of the prisoners in Cuba .

2	Friday the 13th afgekeken, nu My Super Psycho Sweet 16 kijken met @Melissailorkidd
2	Illuminating if overly talky documentary .
2	A disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by Philip Glass .
1	However , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with Stevenson 's tale as well as with earlier Disney efforts .
4	Guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .
3	If there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , I think it 's in projects like the -LRB- unfortunately R-rated -RRB- Paid .
2	A heavy reliance on CGI technology is beginning to creep into the series .
4	Newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , Mark Wahlberg .
0	The story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
4	Tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .
2	Disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids ' books to the screen ... Tuck Everlasting is a little of both .
3	The invincible Werner Herzog is alive and well and living in LA
1	Son of the Bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .
3	A simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them .
4	If this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you ca n't wait to see what happens next .
1	Absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .
4	Together , Tok and O orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death .
4	The tenderness of the piece is still intact .
1	While McFarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story .
3	But in Imax -D , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .
4	... a roller-coaster ride of a movie
4	If it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then SL does just that .
3	friends , couples , miles , and all the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip .
3	A mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser .
2	Hip-hop has a history , and it 's a metaphor for this love story .
1	Somewhere short of Tremors on the modern B-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
2	Unlike most teen flicks , Swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity .
4	It 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many South Koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .
4	A classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done .
2	It is nature against progress .
4	... In this incarnation its fizz is infectious .
4	The film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
4	It is intensely personal and yet -- unlike Quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
4	Waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality .
4	Tim Allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy .
3	Most of Crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness .
4	Rare is the ` urban comedy ' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie .

1	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
0	This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
0	I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
0	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
1	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
0	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
1	But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
2	The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
0	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
0	Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
1	On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
0	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
1	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
0	You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .
2	Brimful .
1	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
2	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
0	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
1	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
0	It 's an awfully derivative story .
0	An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
1	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
1	A woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
0	Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
3	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
1	If this dud had been made in the 's , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
2	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
0	`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
0	What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
0	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
2	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
0	Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
1	If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
3	Never -LRB- sinks -RRB- into exploitation .
2	You can 3 cards so you use them at once or use a special attack ( so if you stock 3 keyblades , Sora does his 3 hit combo .
1	Pros : It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage ! ! !
3	I have n't seen a bargain like that for a while .
1	However , it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF 's heyday .
1	But believe me , this is still not a reccomendation .
3	Score 8.9
2	The second game that was released was n't docked any points .
2	The title track is passable .
3	10/10 Overall , I do n't see why this game got a lower score than the others .
3	It 's like the teams in Sonic Heroes , only the system works better .
2	This ca n't really be helped though , since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur 's Gate 1 ! But these are n't REALLY cons , just some of the things I spotted and said ' That could have been slightly better ' .
3	It 's all about the voice , the human beatbox , and the clap .
1	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand .
3	Graphics : 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character .... But , I guess in the time this came out ... which was I believe ' 97 ..... these graphics still were n't top noch .... Oh well ... I do n't judge games by graphics .... Although ... The cut scenes were fantastic !
2	Marié is completely ga - ga over her new " baby . "
3	GET SSX 3 ! That 's my only conclusion , if you do n't have this game in your collection , get it now while it 's still there and go and shame yourself ! ! !
3	" Just plain fun " I do n't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs .
3	There is so much too do .
3	" Revolutionary " Halo was one of those games you can not live without .
3	Blinded By Fear . Under Azure Skies . It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics .
3	I also have n't encountered any drops in the game 's frame rate .
3	I 'm still on the first level but so far I can yell : THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA !
2	You need to start in a location which is relatively unoccupied by potential enemies , and land grab like crazy .
1	manufactured anger , for a manufactured audience .
2	There are a few complaints I have , but it wo n't keep me from listening to the album .
2	This will make them disappear and anything above the animals in the line will fall to fill the space .
3	No stat - building , no crappy jumps , and NO camera issues .
2	Shimmying , rolling , and swinging will soon become second nature(or else ! ) .
1	Which leads me to believe that this , and other TJB CD 's in Herb Alpert 's Signature Series , were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP 's back in the 1960s ( a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago , which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD ) .
3	So far , so good , I 'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous , Itakagi is my man , too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games ...
3	Gameplay - 10/10 If you 've played a previous Tomb Raider game , then the outcome is predictable : jumping around , shooting bad guys , and the occasional puzzle and boss fight .
2	Well in - battle heartles surround you and you battle , you have cards depending on your attack .
3	* Welcome to Earth * is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain ( more akin to camoflage , depeche mode , and alphaville than moby , prodigy or ministry ) , but offers up no limp wrists .
3	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs , then Baldur 's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs . This is simply one of the best series of games ever made , and any RPG fan simply can not afford to not play it ( and since the whole series is available for a tenner , you do n't exactly have an excuse not to do so ! )
2	DUH ! ! ! IT 'S A FU ... FREAKING WESTERN GAME ! ! !
2	There is a steep learning curve in this game , which can only partly be compensated by starting off with weak enemies .
2	To me it seems as though EA Sports spent a rather large majority of their time developing this game from " scratch " on the graphics .
3	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite : not that the songs do n't stand by themselves , but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one .
2	Well the title of this review says it all .
1	Giving it two stars is generous , and I was n't in the mood .
3	It just won;t bore you .
3	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults .
3	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track ' Sphynx Lightening ' .
1	For example , compare Eric 's lame take of " When You 've Got A Good Friend , " with Savoy Brown 's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On . No contest : Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric 's rendition .
1	And after all these years , we STILL get " Mexican Shuffle " in MONO !
1	And the remake of " Hellhound on My Trail , " Johnson 's signature tune ? ?
2	They bring the rating up from a six , since the cut scenes do n't last long .
1	The next time a company remakes a game for fans , THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST . BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS , WE WILL BE INTERESTED .
2	This album is not as good nor accessible , but remains an enjoyable , second best .
2	I do n't think people should dock it points because it 's the same game .
1	Let 's just say I 'm glad I rented .
3	I did n't experience any slow downs or others issues .
3	Anata is one of those rare bands that has n't yet written a bad song .
3	Simply godly .
2	There 's this one mini - game with go - karts that has you think ' All I have to do is move the joystick and press A !
2	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop . Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly ( Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this ) .
3	Simple , but addicting .
3	Beginning with slow , chugging riffs , it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear , harmonies running rampant .
3	The third song , " Under Azure Skies " , deserves a paragraph of its own .
3	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur 's Gate 1 , and then after completing the first game , import them into Baldur 's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga .
1	Awesome eh ?
2	Drop by your local gamestop and play the demo of this game .
3	We ca n't wait for Beethoven 's Wig 3 !
3	That being said , NBA Live 10 is fan - freakin - tastic !
1	In this day and age of today 's advanced digital technology , a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the ' 60s , was missed .
3	They do stuff their own way .
2	" Do n't believe the hype " I wanted to love this game so bad .
1	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine 's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit .
1	" Almost , but not quite " The game has a feel to it like CoV ( the quest / mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun .
2	Where is the Brad Paisley with the rockin ' guitar sound ?
2	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game , the graphics are nothing amazing , but nothing extremely horrible .
2	Let 's just hope they lose each other 's numbers .
3	Well .... You do what any badass ex - marshal would do ; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu ... nevermind .... You just kill em all .
3	Story - 8.5/10 As before , you have to raid tombs ( hence the name ) , gaining the artifact inside .
3	NG2 does n't disapoint !
3	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story - path for hours on end .
3	Controls : 10/10 Your usual for a FPS ..... You get your regular fire , then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns ... you also got your open doors button ... then your move buttons ... and map ... and jump ... and so on .
3	The intro has PS2 graphics !
3	And on the title track , ' Hyperborea ' , I could see myself on a barren yet breath - taking frozen landscape .
2	Considering the fragile male ego , I would think that most guys want to feel smarter than the game - in - the - box , and would simply give up on this game .
2	Oh , and not just like one of them , but , like , dude , like hundreds , like yo ?
2	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad , typical GameBoy RPG controls , you 'll get used to them very quickly .
2	That backwater is likely the safest location in the game .
3	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game .
3	You really ca n't complain about the controls , since you can modify them to your liking .
3	Story : 8/10 ( same as pretty much any western type anything ) You are a former marshal .... Bad ass dude ... Well , a bunch of people want your land , along with all the land surrounding you ... You kept refusing , so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies , and your wife 's perfume , they murder your wife , burn down your house , and kidnap your kid !
2	Hearing all the songs I remember just brought nothing but memories .
2	I fail to see the new flaws to it that make it worse .
3	-Unlike the original releases , every part of the series is just 1 DVD , which creates a lot less hassle .
3	This record blows my mind .
2	When you opponents attack you see wat card they use , and then you can use your card , if your card 's number is higher you can break the opponents card , a 0 breaks anything but could be as easily broken by something higher .
3	I am looking forward to trying out GC2 , but from the reviews , it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships .
3	Having used the CDs and having read the original book , I am also left wondering how " The Passion of Christ " a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs . Fully recommended
1	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece .
1	If I could return it and get a refund I would .
